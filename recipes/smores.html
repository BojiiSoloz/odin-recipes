    <h2>What are Smores?</h2>

    <p>Smores is a delicous snack that helps create lasting memories. This yummy treat is commonly eaten around the campfire, but tastes just as great out of the oven!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Graham Crackers</li>
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Marshmellows (Preferably the big ones)</li>

        <li>Additional add-ons: 
            <ul>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>Bon Bons</li>
            <li>Carmel</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Peanut Butter</li>
            </ul>
        
    </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Although it is not an ingredient, you will need a skewer in order to hold the smores over the fire.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <p>I recommned starting by organizing all of the treats on a plate beforehand. That way once you are ready to begin, you will have access to everything.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Stick your marshmellow with a skewer</li>
        <li>Roast the marshmellow until it is golden brown, or once the marshmellow has become gooey</li>
        <li>Place the marshmellow on your graham crackers and begin styling it to your liking!</li>
        <li>Eat and enjoy your creation!</li>
    </ol>
